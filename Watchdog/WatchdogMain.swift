/// Reopens the Mac app when it stops without being quit.

/// macOS can end Motif with no warning: when the disk is nearly full it quits apps to purge
/// their caches, and nothing is written to say so. A menu bar app that's gone looks the same
/// as one that's idle, so listening goes unrecorded until someone notices. The app starts
/// this helper at launch with its process ID. When that process ends, ``RunLog`` says whether
/// it was quit on purpose; if not, this opens it again, and the app shows what happened.
///
/// It has no interface and does nothing else. It exits once the app it watches has gone,
/// and the reopened app starts a new one.
