# Contributing to Motif

Bug reports, fixes, tests and new measurements of how Apple's frameworks behave are all welcome, and so are feature ideas! For anything large, please open an issue or a discussion first so that we can all agree on the approach.

## Setting up

You need Xcode 27 and [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen). Anything beyond the simulator also needs an Apple Developer account.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/reallukedev/motif.git
cd motif
brew install xcodegen
xcodegen generate
open Motif.xcodeproj
```

For the simulator, run the Motif (iOS) scheme. The simulator has no Apple Music account, so add `-MotifDemoData YES` under Edit Scheme ' Run ' Arguments to fill an in-memory store with generated history.

To run on a device, or to run the Mac app at all, copy `Config/Local.example.xcconfig` to `Config/Local.xcconfig` and set your team and bundle identifier (see [Building for a device](README.md#building-for-a-device)). For Last.fm, copy `Config/Secrets.example.xcconfig` to `Config/Secrets.xcconfig` and add your own application's key and secret (see [Last.fm](README.md#lastfm)). Both files are gitignored. Don't put your own team or credentials in `Config/Motif.xcconfig`.

Run `xcodegen generate` whenever you add, remove or rename a file. Until you do, the build can't see the change, and the error you get (often a linker error about a missing `_main`) won't point at the cause. Build settings go in `project.yml` or an xcconfig, never in the generated project.

## Conventions

### Comments

A comment should say why the code is the way it is. Many lines in this project look odd and exist because something broke without them; their comments say what broke. Don't delete a comment you don't understand, or tidy the code under it, until you've found out. Comments that restate the code aren't needed.

### Concurrency

The project uses Swift 6 language mode with complete strict concurrency and approachable concurrency. Fix concurrency diagnostics instead of silencing them. If `@unchecked Sendable` is really needed, add a comment saying what makes it safe.

App and widget targets are main-actor by default (`SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor`). `MotifCore` isn't, because it's a library and callers should decide where its work runs. Keep package code `nonisolated`, and `Sendable` where it can be.

SwiftData `@Model` objects must not cross an isolation boundary. Pass a `CaptureSnapshot` or `SessionSnapshot`, or add a snapshot type.

The capture coordinator checks for a duplicate and inserts in one synchronous step. An `await` between the two lets two observations of the same song both get in.

### Where code goes

If something can be decided without MusicKit or a device, it goes in `MotifCore` with tests. That keeps the app targets small and lets the logic be tested without a subscription. Code that touches MusicKit or scripting goes in `MotifMusic`, behind a protocol declared in `MotifCore`.

The SwiftData schema has to stay CloudKit-compatible or sync breaks. Every non-optional property needs a default, `@Attribute(.unique)` isn't allowed, and every relationship is optional with an inverse.

Some identifiers live on people's devices such as the bundle identifier, App Group, iCloud container, widget kinds, Keychain service and `UserDefaults` keys.

### Tests

Write tests with Swift Testing (`import Testing`, `@Test`, `#expect`, `#require`), not XCTest. Where you can, use values captured from a real device, such as an actual queue entry id or notification payload, and add a comment naming the bug the test guards against. A bug fix should come with a test that fails without it, when the logic allows.

### Run it

Most of the serious bugs in this project compiled cleanly and passed the tests. They were found by running the app or reading captured data. Before opening a pull request:

- Run your change. For UI, check light and dark mode and a large Dynamic Type size.
- On the Mac, use a signed build (`./build.sh mac`). An unsigned Mac build runs on an empty in-memory store and can look fine while keeping nothing.
- Automation tools can't open or reliably screenshot the menu bar extra's window, so look at it yourself.
- In the pull request, say what you checked and what you couldn't check.

## Tests and builds

```sh
cd MotifCore && swift test   # package tests, macOS only
./build.sh ci                # same as CI: tests on both, then unsigned iOS and macOS builds
./build.sh test              # package tests on macOS and the iOS Simulator, short output
./build.sh mac               # signed Mac build plus entitlement checks (needs Local.xcconfig)
./build.sh ios               # iOS simulator build
```

`build.sh` uses whichever Xcode `xcode-select -p` points at. Set `DEVELOPER_DIR` to use a different one.

## Commit messages

Match the style in `git log`. The subject is an imperative sentence in sentence case that says what changes for someone using the app:

```
Require a song to play for a while before it counts
Stop the status item naming a song that is not playing
Actually send the scrobbles, rather than only at launch
Keep every song, and recover the ones Motif was not running to see
```

Leave off the trailing period and any `feat:`-style prefix, and keep it under about 72 characters. Wrap the body at about 80 columns and use it to explain what was wrong, why, and how you checked the fix, including anything you couldn't check. Keep each commit to one change.

## Pull requests

Keep them focused and fill in the template. Before asking for review:

- [ ] `cd MotifCore && swift test` passes.
- [ ] `./build.sh ci` passes, or CI is green.
- [ ] New logic in `MotifCore` has tests.
- [ ] You ran the change, and the description says what you checked and what you didn't.
- [ ] Nothing raises a play count or plays music without someone hearing it.
- [ ] You ran `xcodegen generate` after adding, moving or removing files, and didn't commit the generated project.
- [ ] No team ID, bundle identifier or credentials of your own are in tracked files.
- [ ] If you measured something new about Apple's behaviour, `docs/PlatformNotes.md` says so.
