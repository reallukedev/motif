/// Every build before it opened the store with a bare `Schema`, so there is no earlier
/// version to name. SwiftData treats an unversioned store as whatever version its model
/// hashes match and infers a lightweight migration to this one, which covered what it added
/// over the last unversioned build: `Session.deviceID` and the indexes.
///
/// These are copies of the models as they were, attribute for attribute, so a store written
/// by a build with this version still matches it and can be migrated forward. Never change
/// them. CloudKit only accepts additive changes (new optional or defaulted attributes, new
/// models) once the schema is in Production, so a custom stage is for local clean-up, never
/// for renaming or removing a synced field.
