/// ``MotifStore/mergeDuplicateCaptures(policy:)`` settle those, and every device reaches the
/// same answer from its own copy.
///
/// Until this existed, the merge only ran at launch and on a sixty-second timer that only
/// turns while capture is running — so a device that was open but idle showed the duplicates
/// until something else happened to it. Core Data posts
/// `NSPersistentStoreRemoteChange` when the CloudKit mirror writes to the store, which is the
/// actual moment there is something to reconcile.
///
/// The timer stays as a backstop: the notification is the fast path, not the only one.
